1. Simulate a three nodes point-to-point network with duplex links between them. Set the queue size vary the
bandwidth to find the number of packets dropped.
2. Simulate a four node point-to-point network, and connect the links as follows: n0-n2, n1-n2 and n2-n3. Apply
TCP agent between n0-n3 and UDP n1-n3. Apply relevant applications over TCP and UDP agents to determine
the number of packets sent by TCP/UDP
3. Simulate an Ethernet LAN using N nodes .Set multiple traffic nodes and determine collision across different
nodes.
4. Simulate an Ethernet LAN using N-nodes(6-10), change bandwidth and compare the throughput
5. Simulate simple BSS and with transmitting nodes in wire-less LAN. Determine the performance with respect
to transmission of packets.
6. Simulate transmission of ping messages over a network topology and capture the Round TripTime.
7. Simulate a 6 node network to implement Dynamic Routing algorithm and verify itsfunctionality.
8. Implement a method of cyclic data transmission using UDP protocol.
9. Implement using C, the error detecting code CRC for 16 bits.
10. Implement using C ,Hamming Code generation for error detection and correction
11. Simulate a wireless network to test Destination-Sequenced Distance-Vector Routing (DSDV) protocol.
12. Simulate a 7 node network to verify Link State Routing protocol.
